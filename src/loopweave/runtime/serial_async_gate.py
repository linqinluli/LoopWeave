"""Serial-Async baseline tenant time-slicing gate.

Serial-Async is the status-quo baseline: the cluster is statically allocated
and tenants time-share it, each owning all GPUs for ``k`` RL iterations before
yielding. The frozen base stays resident; only the active LoRA adapter and
optimizer state change between tenants.

The gate enforces that semantics at the LoopWeave request entry:

- Training-run creation is serialized: only one tenant's training run may be
  alive at a time (single create slot), so its GPU resources are always
  schedulable.
- The tenant that owns the create slot is ``promote``d to be the active run;
  its sample/forward/optim requests proceed, everyone else waits.
- The active run consumes an iteration budget of ``iterations_per_slice``
  optimizer steps; when the budget is exhausted the gate evicts the run
  (freeing its GPUs) and admits the next waiting tenant.
